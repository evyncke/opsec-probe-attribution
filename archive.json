As for the receiver, it may or may not process the packet, depending on where the \"probe description URI\" is included (e.g., TCP SYN flag with the URI included in data). As a consequence, a response may not be received. The choice of the URI location is important but depends on the use case, which is why multiple possibilities are proposed. In all cases, the probing rate should be done at a rate low enough to not unduly impact the destination.\r\n```",

So either we have the following:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n-        Description: This is the description of the measurement\r\n+        Description: This is a description of the measurement. For instance, the in-band probe attribution was used by [I-D.draft-vyncke-v6ops-james].\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr we specify that the \"Description\" field can be multiline and have the following:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n-        Description: This is the description of the measurement\r\n+        Description: This is a multiline description of the measurement.\r\n+                     For instance, the in-band probe attribution was used\r\n+                     by [I-D.draft-vyncke-v6ops-james].\r\n```\r\n\r\nPros: this document introduces it, so we can specify it. Cons: doesn't match RFC 9116's grammar, which is not good.\r\n\r\nThoughts? I'd go for the first IMHO (which is equal to a -very long- line, not a multiline).",
